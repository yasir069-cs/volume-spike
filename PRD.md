# PRD.md — Crypto Signal Bot

## What to build
A signals-only bot that scans the **full Binance USDT-M futures** market every
5 minutes, **24 hours a day** (288 scans/day — the original 18:00–23:00 IST
session window was retired; the bot no longer has quiet hours) and decides
**LONG / SHORT / NO_TRADE** with a **deterministic price-action & market-context
core** (market structure → S/R → liquidity → price action → trendlines → MTF →
futures context → risk gate; indicators only confirm). It reads top-down
(1H bias → 15M setup → 5M entry), sets entry/SL/TP/RR, and sends Telegram alerts.
An LLM (**self-hosted Ollama / any OpenAI-compatible provider**) writes the
**explanation only**, records a background **opinion audit** it cannot act on,
and can never change or drop a decision. The decision hierarchy is defined in
**[price_action_spec.md](price_action_spec.md)** (primary authority); the owner's
handwritten indicator note **[strategy_spec.md](strategy_spec.md)** is the
secondary confirmation layer.

## Targeted users
Solo trader (Yasir) — personal use only. The owner can't watch the market all
day; the bot watches it and rings Telegram when a setup meets the bar.

## Core requirements
1. The bot must decide on **market structure & context first** (price_action_spec.md);
   indicators are secondary confirmation only.
2. Alerts must be **correct and on time** — never late, never bleed past a scan slot.
3. **`NO_TRADE` is valid and preferred** when confluence is thin — never force a trade.

## Core features
1. Full futures scan (all USDT-M pairs) every 5 minutes, 288 scans/day, 24/7.
2. Stablecoin + leveraged-token exclusion; 24h volume ≥ $5M filter
   (owner alignment, Phase 1: $50M starved the universe to ~80 coins).
3. **Deterministic decision core** (`decision.decide`): market structure → S/R
   zones → liquidity & sweeps → price action & volume → trendlines → MTF
   (mandatory) → futures context → risk/reward gate (mandatory) → LONG/SHORT/NO_TRADE.
4. Liquidity as primary evidence: a long needs a **sell-side sweep + reclaim +
   mandatory confirmation** (mirror for a short); indicators (RSI/EMA/VWAP/BB) fold
   in only as a **bounded secondary** sub-score, never a gate.
5. Batched LLM **explanation** with retry, a secondary model, and a per-day budget
   (`AI_DAILY_BUDGET=0` = unlimited for a self-hosted Ollama);
   a local template writes the explanation when the LLM is unavailable.
6. Funding-rate-aware leverage + risk-based position size (2% of ACCOUNT_BALANCE).
7. Telegram alerts with a **Market Context (primary)** block (structure / HTF bias /
   target zone / liquidity), an **Indicators (secondary)** block, and trade levels.
   NO_TRADE → HOLD stays silent.
8. Duplicate guard (20 min cooldown per coin, expired entries pruned every
   scan — 24/7-correct, no session reset).
9. Append-only `signals_log.csv` (30 columns) with startup header migration.
10. Timeliness guarantees: single non-overlapping cron job, OHLCV cache,
    concurrent fetch, hard 285s per-scan deadline (`SCAN_DEADLINE_SECONDS`).
11. In-Telegram chat assistant + commands (`/status`, `/signals`, `/strategy`).

## Out of scope
- Auto trade execution (no `create_order`, no exchange API keys).
- Web dashboard.
- Multi-user.
- LLM reasoning mode (documented token-starvation issue; stays off).
