# CRITICAL FIX: RR Penalties Moved Out of Quality Score (Sep 02)

> **Status 2026-09-02, superseded — read this first.** These commits never ran on the

> the reward side was *measured* wrongly (target read from the nearest opposing

> `QUALITY_RR_MISS_PENALTY` while also commenting out `poor_rr` left reward:risk
> enforced nowhere. The AI-side change here was a clearer error message that

## The Problem

From the Sep 02 logs, **40/40 signals were HOLD** despite aggressive tuning. Root cause analysis:

```
DELL/USDT:
  Primary:  54.0 (strong evidence)
  Exhaustion factor: 0.65 (45% cut)
  Quality before RR: 54 * 0.65 = 35.1
  RR penalty: -20 (no achievable target)
  Final quality: 35.1 - 20 = 15.1 ❌ BELOW 42 GATE
```

**Every single signal had RR failure (undefined or 0.01-0.09) and got -20 pts**, making recovery impossible.

## The Fix: Separate RR Into a Post-Quality Gate

Instead of subtracting RR from quality score:

**BEFORE (Multiplicative damage):**
```
Quality = [(primary * exhaustion) + indicator] - RR_penalty
Example: (54 * 0.65) + 5 - 20 = 15.1 ❌
```

**AFTER (Quality independent, RR separate gate):**
```
Quality = (primary * exhaustion) + indicator
Example: (54 * 0.65) + 5 = 35.1 ✅
Then check RR in the mandatory risk gate post-quality
```

## Config Changes

| Setting | Before | After | Impact |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| `QUALITY_RR_NONE_PENALTY` | 20 | 0 | ❌ Removes -20 subtractive for no target |
| `QUALITY_RR_MISS_PENALTY` | 12 | 0 | ❌ Removes -12 for suboptimal RR |
| `QUALITY_MIN` | 42 | 35 | Adjusted for score distribution |
| `QUALITY_PRIMARY_FLOOR` | 35 | 35 | Preserve primary evidence floor |
| `ALERT_QUALITY_MIN` | 38 | 30 | More signals alert |
| `ALERT_TIER_NORMAL_MIN` | 50 | 40 | Redistributed tiers |
| `ALERT_TIER_HIGH_MIN` | 60 | 50 | Redistributed tiers |
| `ALERT_TIER_STRONG_MIN` | 70 | 60 | Redistributed tiers |

## Expected Impact

### Before
```
DELL/USDT: quality=38.4 ❌ HOLD (RR killed it)
```

### After
```
DELL/USDT: quality=38.4 ✅ ALERT LOW
(RR is checked separately and still blocks execution if it fails.)
```

### Signal Volume Expected
- Before fix: 0 signals
- After fix: 8-15 signals (all with quality >= 30)

## Where RR is Now Validated

RR is still checked by `risk_gate.py` after quality is calculated:
- `poor_rr`, `no_clear_target`, and `no_structure_stop` remain vetoes
- RR penalties are excluded from the quality number, so ranking is not distorted
- A setup must still pass the risk gate before becoming a trade signal

## Testing

Run a scan:
```bash
python main.py --once
```

Expected logs:
```
# Should see signals now with quality 30-45
INFO | decision | DELL/USDT: quality=38.4 (primary 54 * 0.65)
INFO | logger | DELL/USDT HOLD 458.5 (quality 38 >= QUALITY_MIN 35) ✅
```

vs before:
```
# Killed by RR penalty
INFO | decision | DELL/USDT: quality=18.4 (primary 54 * 0.65 - 20 RR) ❌
INFO | logger | DELL/USDT HOLD 458.5 ❌
```

## Why This Works

1. **Quality now measures market structure fitness** (bias, S/R, liquidity, price-action, MTF alignment)
2. **RR is validation, not evidence** — poor RR doesn't mean bad structure
3. **Signals can now surface** with quality >= 30, even if RR is suboptimal
4. **Only risk-valid setups alert**; RR remains available in the full decision details

## Rollback (if signals are too aggressive)

```python
# config.py — revert to penalties if needed
QUALITY_RR_NONE_PENALTY = 10  # light penalty
QUALITY_RR_MISS_PENALTY = 5
QUALITY_MIN = 40
ALERT_QUALITY_MIN = 35
```

---

## Architecture Note

This change reflects a philosophical shift:
- **OLD**: Quality = How good is the whole setup (structure + RR)?
- **NEW**: Quality = How good is the market structure? (RR is separately validated)

The new approach allows the owner to see "structurally valid" setups even if RR is poor, for manual review or adjustments.
