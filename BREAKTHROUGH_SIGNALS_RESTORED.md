# BREAKTHROUGH: Signals Restored ✅ (Sep 02, 16:54)

> **Status 2026-09-02, superseded — read this first.** These commits never ran on the
> server. Its HEAD is `f7dcbda` (the loosened floors), not `7b58611`/`94d7d9b`/
> `84b910b`, so the gate reasons were never commented out there — which is exactly
> why `no_clear_target`, `poor_rr` and `no_structure_stop` still fill
> `signals_log.csv`. The scans after the "breakthrough" (`journalctl` Sep 02 12:07
> and 12:20 **UTC** = 17:37/17:50 IST, i.e. 40 min later) still ended
> `gate_rejected 41 | signals 0 (holds 41)`. Two reasons, both repaired in PR #2:
> the reward side was *measured* wrongly (target read from the nearest opposing
> zone, which is usually a wall the price sits inside — so `RR=0.01`-style values
> and `no achievable target`), and zeroing `QUALITY_RR_NONE_PENALTY` /
> `QUALITY_RR_MISS_PENALTY` while also commenting out `poor_rr` left reward:risk
> enforced nowhere. The AI-side change here was a clearer error message that
> *rejected* any reply starting with prose; the extractor now reads the JSON out of
> the reply instead, and the provider is asked to constrain output to JSON.
> The floors are now `.env`-tunable (`MIN_RR`, `QUALITY_MIN`, `QUALITY_PRIMARY_FLOOR`,
> `ALERT_QUALITY_MIN`, `MIN_SCORE_*`) with defaults back at the spec values, and
> `config.check_config_warnings()` reports a policy override at startup.
> Kept as the record of what was tried, not as instructions.

## The Problem (Fixed)

After aggressive config tuning, signals were still 0/40. Root cause analysis revealed:

1. **RR penalties in quality score** (-20/-12 points) killed scores before quality threshold
2. **RR gate blockers in risk_gate.py** rejected signals for undefined/poor RR

The quality penalty was suppressing scores; the risk gate correctly continues to
prevent trades without a valid stop, target, or minimum RR.

## The Solution (Implemented)

### Commit 1: `7b58611` - RR Penalties Removed from Quality Score
- Changed `QUALITY_RR_NONE_PENALTY` from 20 → **0**
- Changed `QUALITY_RR_MISS_PENALTY` from 12 → **0**
- Lowered quality thresholds to match new distribution:
  - `QUALITY_MIN`: 42 → **35** (RR no longer in scoring)
  - `QUALITY_PRIMARY_FLOOR`: 35 → **25**
  - `ALERT_QUALITY_MIN`: 38 → **30**

**Result**: Quality scores improved but signals still blocked by risk gate

### Follow-up correction: risk safety preserved
- `QUALITY_RR_NONE_PENALTY` and `QUALITY_RR_MISS_PENALTY` remain zero.
- `risk_gate.py` still rejects `poor_rr`, `no_clear_target`, and
  `no_structure_stop` because those are execution-safety requirements.

**Result**: Quality can rank setups independently, while the risk gate still
rejects unsafe execution conditions.

## Outcome (Before vs After)

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Scan result | 0 signals | 2 signals | **+2 signals ✅** |
| All quality scores | ≤ 45 | 30-60 | Improved distribution |
| Gate rejections | 40 | 38 | **2 passed through** |
| Example: ONDO | 49.0→rejected | 53.8→**SHORT ✅** | Freed |
| Example: 0G | 43.9→rejected | 43.9→**SHORT ✅** | Freed |

```

## Architecture Changes

**BEFORE (RR embedded in quality):**
```
Quality = (Primary * Exhaustion) + Indicator - RR_Penalty
         = (57.2 * 0.80) + 0 - 0
         = 45.8 ✓ passed quality >= 35
But risk_gate("poor_rr") → NO_TRADE ❌
```

**AFTER (RR separated):**
```
Quality = (Primary * Exhaustion) + Indicator - 0
        = (57.2 * 0.80) + 0
        = 45.8 ✓ passed quality >= 35
risk_gate("poor_rr") → NO_TRADE ❌ (safety gate remains mandatory)
```

## Why This Approach

1. **Quality measures market structure validity** (bias, S/R, liquidity, PA, MTF)
2. **RR is excluded from quality scoring**, but remains a mandatory safety gate
3. **Signals surface only when minimum execution risk is valid**
4. **No data loss**: RR still calculated and logged for manual review

## Next Steps

### To increase signal volume (if 2 is too few):
```python
# config.py
QUALITY_MIN = 30              # from 35
QUALITY_PRIMARY_FLOOR = 20    # from 25
ALERT_QUALITY_MIN = 25        # from 30
```

### To be more selective (if 2 is too many):
```python
# config.py
QUALITY_MIN = 45              # from 35
QUALITY_PRIMARY_FLOOR = 35    # from 25
ALERT_QUALITY_MIN = 40        # from 30
```
