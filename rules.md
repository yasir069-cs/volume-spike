# rules.md — Coding Rules

> Decision authority is **[price_action_spec.md](price_action_spec.md)** (primary);
> the indicator note **[strategy_spec.md](strategy_spec.md)** is the secondary
> confirmation layer. These are the engineering rules the code must obey.

## Libraries to use
- `ccxt` → exchange data only (Binance USDT-M futures, public mode)
- `pandas-ta` → ALL indicator calculations (never manual math)
- `requests` → the AI provider's HTTP endpoint (`AI_BASE_URL`, AgentRouter by
  default) for the primary per-coin decision and chat assistant
- `python-telegram-bot` → alerts + chat listener
- `APScheduler` → timer (never `sleep()` loops)
- `python-dotenv` → load `.env` secrets
- `logging` → all logs (never `print`)
- `csv` → signal log file

## Hard rules
- **No auto trade execution — signals only.** No `create_order`, no Binance API keys.
- No paid exchange APIs — CCXT public mode only.
- No hardcoded secrets — always `.env`.
- No bare `except` — catch specific exceptions.
- No manual indicator math — pandas-ta only.
- Python collects and calculates the full evidence; Ollama independently owns
  the primary LONG/SHORT/NO_TRADE opinion for each basic-filter survivor.
- Python may veto only malformed data, invalid SL/TP or risk geometry, and
  duplicate delivery. Deterministic setup quality is evidence, not an AI gate.
- Never send a duplicate Telegram alert within `DUPLICATE_COOLDOWN_MIN` (20 min) for the same coin; this includes AI review summaries.
- A scan must never bleed past `SCAN_DEADLINE_SECONDS` (285) into the next slot.

## Scheduler rules
- Timezone: Asia/Kolkata (IST = UTC+5:30, no DST).
- Active: 24 hours a day, every 5 minutes.
- **One** cron job with `second=15` offset; `max_instances=1`, `misfire_grace_time=120`,
  `coalesce=True`. No overlapping jobs.
- There are no inactive hours; market and AI calls run continuously under the
  single-scan coordinator.

## Scanner rules
- Always fetch ALL USDT-M futures pairs (never hardcode a list).
- Exclude stablecoin bases (`EXCLUDED_BASES`) and leveraged tokens (UP/DOWN/BULL/BEAR).
- Volume filter: skip coins with 24h volume < `$50M` USDT.
- Check the duplicate guard **before** fetching OHLCV for a coin.
- OHLCV TTL cache keyed `(symbol, timeframe)`; concurrent fetch capped at
  `FETCH_MAX_WORKERS` with a shared token bucket.
- Only CLOSED candles, and never invent history: a frame shorter than the
  requested window is served at its real length when it still covers
  `FRAME_MIN_CANDLES` (40) candles — a fresh listing is readable, just with less
  indicator warm-up — and dropped (with one WARNING) below that. Rejecting on
  "fewer rows than asked for" made every newly listed perp permanently invisible.

## Indicator rules
- RSI period 14 · EMA period 21 · VWAP daily · Bollinger 20/2 · ATR 14.
- `bbands(ddof=0)` (population std, TradingView-compatible).
- 50 strategy candles + 250 warm-up candles per timeframe; only closed candles.

## Decision-core rules (decision.py — the brain)
- `decision.decide(frames, funding_rate, oi_df, cfg)` is the **single** decider,
  live and backtest. It returns `LONG` / `SHORT` / `NO_TRADE` + full evidence.
- Evaluate the hierarchy in priority order: market structure → S/R zones →
  liquidity & sweeps → price action & volume → trendlines → **MTF (mandatory)** →
  futures context → **risk/reward gate (mandatory)** → indicators (secondary).
- **`NO_TRADE` is valid and preferred** when multi-factor confluence is thin — a
  trade is never forced.
- Look-ahead-safe: detectors see only closed candles ≤ the decision bar.
- NO_TRADE gates (each a named constant): no directional bias, `counter_htf` when
  `MTF_REQUIRE_HTF_ALIGN`, primary `< QUALITY_PRIMARY_FLOOR` (45), quality
  `< QUALITY_MIN` (50), and risk-gate fails (`rr < MIN_RR` 1.5, stop
  `> RISK_MAX_STOP_ATR`, opposing zone `< RISK_MIN_TARGET_ATR`, spread too wide).
- `setup_quality` weights (sum 100): structure 25 · S/R 20 · liquidity 20 ·
  price action 15 · MTF 10 · trendline 5 · futures 5. Indicators add only a
  **bounded secondary term**, floored out below the primary floor.
- Futures context (OI + funding) is contextual and **safe-degrades**: missing data
  → `available=False` + a `data_warnings` entry, never a fabricated value.

## Secondary indicator scorer (scoring.py)
- Repurposed as `indicator_confirmation(snap, direction, cfg) → {score, agrees, notes}`.
- The graded component fns (zone / RSI / volume / Bollinger / sweep) are reused as
  a bounded confirmation sub-score — they **no longer hard-gate** a coin.
- Legacy sweep scoring: absence caps confidence at `NO_SWEEP_CONFIDENCE_CAP` (69,
  just below the STRONG tier) and is labelled in the alert. The **primary** sweep
  logic lives in `liquidity.py`
  (sweep + reclaim + mandatory confirmation, `LIQ_CONFIRM_REQUIRED`).
- Alert tiers (owner's rule, 2026-09-01): quality < 30 → ignored (log-only);
  30-40 → LOW alert; 40-50 → NORMAL alert; 50-60 → HIGH alert; 60+ → STRONGEST alert.

## AI transport rules (shared by every provider call)
- The endpoint is `chat_completions_url()`, resolved on **every call**. A
  module-level constant frozen from `config.AI_BASE_URL` at import kept posting to
  the old host whenever the base URL changed later.
- Headers come from one place: auth, JSON accept, and the browser-like
  `User-Agent` the provider's WAF requires (bare `python-requests` gets
  challenged). Every caller reuses it rather than copying the dict.
- `stream: False` is explicit — some gateways default to SSE and the reply then
  fails JSON parsing.

## AI rules (ai_decision.py — confluence-gated decision review)
- The LLM is called only for candidates with measured confluence >= 60/100.
  Its decision workflow is 1H structure/bias -> 15M confirmation -> 5M entry,
  using RSI, EMA21, VWAP, volume, location, S/R, SL, TP, and RR as core data.
  Liquidation sweep, websocket liquidations, funding, OI, and other context are
  optional supporting evidence and must never be fabricated.
- Every answered LLM verdict produces a mandatory Telegram AI summary. The
  summary is explicitly review-only; Python risk gates still control whether a
  normal executable-style alert is emitted.
- The audit answer is graded against the emitted verdict in `ai_opinions.csv`
  (`AGREE` / `DISAGREE` / `VETO_PROPOSED` / `SIGNAL_PROPOSED` / `NO_ANSWER`) and
  `final_decision` always names what actually shipped. An opinion can earn trust
  over time; it cannot buy a veto.
- `--force-llm` is the only harness where a verdict is applied, and only after the
  hard gates re-validate it (data validity, level sanity, stop width, min R/R,
  quality floor).
- Provider AgentRouter (`AI_BASE_URL`). Primary `AI_MODEL`
  (`deepseek-v4-flash`), optional `AI_MODEL_FALLBACK` (empty by default), then the
  local template. Explanations are written by the local template **today**.
- **Batch** candidates (sorted by `setup_quality`, chunked at `AI_BATCH_MAX=20`)
  into one request → JSON array keyed by symbol.
- **Retry** `AI_RETRY_MAX=3` per model with exponential backoff on 429/5xx/timeout/bad-JSON.
- `AI_MAX_TOKENS=2000`; `AI_REASONING_ENABLED=False` (token cap starves JSON if on).
- Per-IST-day budget `AI_DAILY_BUDGET=50`; notify Telegram once when exhausted —
  the worker calls `ai_decision.budget_exhausted_notice()` after every batch, since
  retries spend the budget too and silence would otherwise be indistinguishable
  from "nothing worth alerting".
- Prompt fidelity: what the model is told must match what the code measured. The
  scheduled scan carries `feat_1h` into the bundle (the 1H sweep is real, not
  "none detected"); liquidity flags are named by the pool they swept
  (`long_ready` = a swept SELL-side pool, i.e. supports LONG); `range_pos` is
  labelled against `CANDLE_LIMIT` (50), not the 20-candle swing window.

## AI output-contract rules (ai_decision.py)
- The JSON requirement is enforced in the REQUEST, not only in the prompt:
  decision calls send `response_format={"type":"json_object"}` when the provider
  accepts it. A 400 that names `response_format` disables the capability for the
  process (one wasted request, never one per scan) and the audit line reports
  `json_mode=off`.
- Parsing is tolerant of punctuation, never of absence. Prose before/after the JSON
  is skipped, fences stripped, an envelope key unwound, and a truncated block is
  cut back to its last complete element. A verdict that never arrived is **absent**
  — the setup keeps the deterministic answer. No repair may fabricate one.
- The two failure classes are retried differently. Transport (429/5xx/timeout) is
  retried identically; a parse failure (`AIDecisionError.parse_failure`) is retried
  with an explicit correction turn, plus a larger `max_tokens` up to
  `AI_MAX_TOKENS_RETRY_CAP` when `finish_reason=length` (or an unterminated block)
  says the reply was cut off. Re-sending the same prompt to a model that answered in
  prose is how the live box spent 9 budget units a scan for nothing.
- Every batch logs one `AI AUDIT <scan>: n/m answered | LONG x SHORT y NO_TRADE z |
  applied=never (audit-only) | json_mode=…` line, and `AIOpinionWorker.status()`
  carries the same tallies for `/status`. The counters reset at the START of a run,
  so a batch that dies mid-flight reports 0 answered rather than the previous
  scan's success.
- `ai_used` means "a model verdict replaced the deterministic one" and stays False
  on scheduled scans by design. It must not be repurposed as an "AI is working"
  signal, and never make the model a decision stage to make it True — the owner's
  rule is audit-only until `agreement` in `ai_opinions.csv` justifies a change.

## Fallback rules (fallback.py)
- The **decision** never falls back — the deterministic core always decides.
- LLM unavailable → `explanation_fallback(decision)` writes a local template from
  the decision's structured evidence.
- Alert footer: `Decision by deterministic core · explanation generated locally`.

## Duplicate guard rules
- Two independent windows, both reset at session end (23:00 IST):
- **Alert cooldown** `DUPLICATE_COOLDOWN_MIN` (20): checked for every candidate
    before its 15M/5M fetch, recorded only for alerted BUY/SELL. A HOLD must never
    occupy it — that would mute a real setup appearing minutes later.
  - **HOLD log cooldown** `HOLD_LOG_COOLDOWN_MIN` (30): an identical rejection
    (same verdict + same blocking reason) is appended once per window per coin; a
    changed verdict or reason is new information and is always written.

## Signal log rules
- Append every BUY/SELL/HOLD to `signals_log.csv`; never delete or truncate.
- Row built generically from `config.CSV_COLUMNS` (28 columns).
- On startup, `migrate_csv_header()` archives a stale-header file to `.vN.bak`;
  `ai_opinions.csv` reconciles its header the same way before appending.
- CSV first, Telegram second: the row is persisted before delivery, and a write
  error is contained per row (`main._persist` → `log_failed`) so one bad row can
  never cost the rest of the scan its alerts.
- Log level: BUY/SELL at INFO, HOLD at DEBUG — the audit trail keeps the row, the
  journal keeps the events.

## Risk-gate rules (risk_gate.py)
- SL comes off structure, padded by `RISK_SL_BUFFER_ATR`; TP comes off the nearest
  **usable** opposing zone, padded back by `RISK_TARGET_ZONE_PAD_ATR`.
- "Usable" means the zone lies beyond the entry and the padded level stays on the
  right side of it. Zones are scanned nearest-first (`RISK_TARGET_SCAN_ZONES`) and
  an unusable one is skipped, not fatal — the price of the old nearest-only rule was
  21/37 live coins rejected as "no achievable target" while a valid level sat a few
  ATR deeper.
- A level that cannot be reached is reported as `no_clear_target` with **no** TP;
  a TP is never fabricated on the wrong side of the entry for a row that HOLDs.
- `into_opposing_zone` (price already pressing into the zone) stays a hard reject:
  that is no room, not a measurement gap.

## Telegram command rules (telegram_bot.py)
- `/scan_on` and `/scan_off` are **owner-only**, and the check **fails closed**:
  `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is the allow-list (comma-separated for several chats), and an
  unset value authorises *nobody*. It used to authorise *everybody* — "no
  restriction if chat_id not configured" handed a 24/7 scan session and the AI
  daily budget to anyone who found the bot.
- A refusal names its reason: unconfigured says set `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`,
  non-owner says access denied. Both paths return before any command side effect,
  so a regression in the guard shows up as a failed assertion, not a live scan
  started from a test.
- Read-only commands (`/status`, `/signals`, `/strategy`, `/help`, `/clear`, the
  chat assistant) stay open to whoever can reach the bot; only *control* is gated.

## Chat assistant rules (chat_assistant.py)
- The assistant shares `ai_decision`'s transport (`ai_decision.complete_chat`) —
  same endpoint resolved per call, same browser-like User-Agent, same retry
  ladder and the same daily budget. Hand-rolling a second `requests.post` gave it
  none of that: it died on the first 503 and its requests were invisible to the
  cap they were spending.
- Chat consumes the AI budget and says so via `budget_status()`; it is a provider
  request like any other, not free.
- A failed call answers with a clear "not answering right now", never an invented
  reply. `/status`, `/signals`, `/strategy` work without the AI entirely.

## Secrets and .env rules
- Never paste a credential into this repo — not in docs, not in a test fixture.
  The leak-watchdog in `config.py` stores **prefixes only**
  (`_EXPOSED_TELEGRAM_TOKENS` / `_EXPOSED_OPENROUTER_KEYS`); a full value in the
  list would be the very leak it exists to detect. `test_credentials.py` once held
  the live bot token verbatim, which is how it reached public Git history — a test
  now scans every tracked file for a full-shaped secret so it cannot come back.
- Rotate first, then extend the prefix list with the leaked value's prefix, so
  startup keeps warning until every host is updated. The warning silences itself
  once `.env` carries a new credential.
- Startup validates the AI config (`config.check_config_warnings()`) and logs
  `CONFIG:` lines for a malformed `AI_BASE_URL` (quotes, spaces, a copied
  markdown link), an empty `AI_MODEL`, a fallback equal to the primary, and a
  model with no key. Those are silent-failure modes: the visible symptom is an
  `ai_opinions.csv` full of FAILED rows while the daily budget keeps burning.

## Error handling
- Exchange fetch fails → retry with backoff → skip coin.
- AI fails → `fallback.py` local explanation (the decision is unaffected).
- Telegram fails → log error, continue the bot (never crash on a send).
- Rate limit → exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s).
