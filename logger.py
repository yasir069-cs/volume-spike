"""Signal logger.

Appends every BUY / SELL / HOLD signal to signals_log.csv. The row is built
generically from config.CSV_COLUMNS, so adding a column to that list is enough
to start recording it — a field can never again be silently dropped because
this module hand-listed a shorter set of keys than the header declares.

Append-only: the file is never truncated or deleted. If the on-disk header no
longer matches CSV_COLUMNS (an older run wrote fewer columns), the old file is
archived to signals_log.csv.v1.bak and a fresh file with the correct header is
started — the history is preserved in the archive, never overwritten in place.
