"""ScanCoordinator — one scan at a time, bounded services, observable state.

Every scan entry point (scheduled APScheduler job, Telegram /scan_on
on-demand session, --once demo) passes through the same coordinator:

    SCAN A running -> SCAN B requested -> B does not start ("scan already
    active"). A single non-blocking lock enforces this at process level —
    the bot is one systemd service, so threading is the right scope (no
    Redis/Kafka/distributed locking).

The coordinator also owns:
  * ONE DuplicateGuard for all paths (scheduled and on-demand scans used to
    carry separate guards, so a coin alerted by one path was immediately
    re-alerted by the other).
  * stage timings for the running/last scan (universe, funding, OHLCV...).
  * the last-scan health snapshot /status reads.
  * the background AI opinion worker: the deterministic pipeline persists and
    emits its signals during the scan; AI verdicts are computed afterwards in
    a single-worker executor and recorded to ai_opinions.csv. A slow, failing
    or malformed AI response can therefore never delay or break a scan, and
    the next scheduled scan always starts on time.

AI states: PENDING -> SUCCESS | FAILED | TIMEOUT | UNAVAILABLE.
