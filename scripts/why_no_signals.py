"""Why did the bot alert nothing? Read the answer out of the log instead of guessing.

Every decision the pipeline makes — signalled or not — is appended to
signals_log.csv with its `no_trade_reason` codes, so the record of "0 signals from
41 decisions" already says which layer did it. This script reads that file only:
no exchange calls, no bot interaction, no writes. It prints

  * one block per scan (rows grouped by the minute they were logged, so rows
    written by an older build are never averaged together with the newest run);
  * a histogram of reason codes, labelled with the layer that produced them;
  * for each layer, how many decisions would clear if that layer alone were
    repaired — the honest "fixing the target buys me N alerts" number;
  * the setup-quality / RR spread of the rows still blocked, so a floor is chosen
    from the data rather than from intuition.

Funding and duplicate rejections are absent by design: they stop a coin before
`decision.decide` runs, so nothing is logged for them (see the scan summary line).

Usage: python scripts/why_no_signals.py [--file signals_log.csv] [--scans N]
       [--all] [--fix target,stop] [--alert-min N]
