# Architecture — Crypto Signal Bot

> The decision hierarchy is authoritative in **[price_action_spec.md](price_action_spec.md)**;
> the owner's indicator note in **[strategy_spec.md](strategy_spec.md)** is the
> secondary confirmation layer. This file describes the runtime architecture.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Exchange:** CCXT — Binance **USDT-M futures**, public mode, no API key
- **Decision core:** `decision.py` orchestrates deterministic detectors
  (`market_structure`, `support_resistance`, `liquidity`, `price_action`,
  `trendlines`, `mtf`, `futures_context`) → `setup_quality` → `risk_gate` →
  LONG / SHORT / NO_TRADE. Look-ahead-safe; identical in live and backtest.
- **Indicators (secondary):** pandas-ta (RSI 14, EMA21, daily VWAP, Bollinger 20/2,
  ATR 14) fold in via `scoring.indicator_confirmation` — a bounded confirmation
  sub-score, never a gate or the direction-chooser
- **AI (audit + explanation, never a decision):** AgentRouter
  (`https://agentrouter.org/v1`) — `deepseek-v4-flash` primary,
  `AI_MODEL_FALLBACK` empty by default; a local template writes the prose today.
  Background opinions land in `ai_opinions.csv` with an `agreement` grade and can
  never change an emitted signal.
- **Alerts / chat:** python-telegram-bot (`alerts.py` sender, `telegram_bot.py`
  long-lived chat listener, `chat_assistant.py` LLM Q&A)
- **Scheduler:** APScheduler `BlockingScheduler`, timezone Asia/Kolkata (IST)
- **Logs:** Python logging → signals appended to `signals_log.csv`

## Schedule

- **Window:** 18:00 – 23:00 IST, every 5 minutes.
- **One** `CronTrigger(hour="*", minute="*/5", second=15)` → **288 scans/day**.
  The `second=15` offset publishes the just-closed 5M candle; a single job means no
  hour-boundary overlap. `max_instances=1`, `misfire_grace_time=120`, `coalesce=True`.
- **Outside the window:** zero market/AI calls. A session-start and session-end
  Telegram message bracket each evening; session-end reports a health line (scans
  ran, signals sent) so silence is confirmed-healthy, not a dead bot.

## Full flow (every 5 minutes)

```
STEP 1 — Universe
  fetch_tickers() → all USDT-M futures pairs
  drop stablecoin / leveraged-token bases (EXCLUDED_BASES + UP/DOWN/BULL/BEAR)
  drop 24h volume < $50M USDT
  → active liquid coins

STEP 2 — Duplicate guard FIRST
  coin signalled in the last 15 min? → skip before any OHLCV fetch

STEP 3 — Retain frames
  cached OHLCV (per-TF TTL) for 1H (HTF), 15M (setup), 5M (entry) — kept, not discarded,
  and handed as { "1h": HTF, "15m": setup, "5m": entry } to the decision core

STEP 4 — decision.decide(frames, funding, oi)   [deterministic core, look-ahead-safe]
  1 market structure per TF → mtf.combine → htf_bias + direction (+ counter_htf)
      direction is None (no HTF bias / range)         → NO_TRADE("no_directional_bias")
  2 support/resistance zones   3 liquidity & sweeps (reclaim + mandatory confirm)
  4 price action & volume      5 trendlines/channels (confluence only)
  6 multi-TF (mandatory): entry TF opposes HTF        → NO_TRADE("counter_htf")
  7 OI + funding via futures_context (contextual; safe-degrade, no fabricated data)
  9 indicators fold in as a BOUNDED secondary sub-score (scoring.indicator_confirmation)
  → setup_quality: primary < QUALITY_PRIMARY_FLOOR(45) → NO_TRADE("insufficient_primary_evidence")
                   quality  < QUALITY_MIN(50)          → NO_TRADE("low_setup_quality")
  8 risk_gate (mandatory): structure SL, target off the nearest opposing zone that
      is actually usable — zones are scanned nearest-first (RISK_TARGET_SCAN_ZONES)
      and one that straddles the entry, or whose padded level would land on the
      wrong side of it, is skipped rather than turning a valid setup into
      "no achievable target"; the chosen level must still clear RISK_MIN_TARGET_ATR
      rr < MIN_RR(1.5) / stop > 3·ATR / price AT an opposing zone < 1·ATR / wide spread → NO_TRADE(reason)
  → LONG / SHORT / NO_TRADE + entry/SL/TP/RR + setup_quality + full evidence + no_trade_reasons
    (NO_TRADE is valid & PREFERRED when confluence is thin — a trade is never forced)

STEP 5 — Rank
  tradable survivors ranked by setup_quality; the strongest get scarce resources first

STEP 6 — Explanation + opinion audit (both cosmetic)
  a finished decision → natural-language prose (fallback.explanation_fallback today;
  batched-LLM path retained) AND, in the background, one batched request whose
  answer is graded against the emitted verdict in ai_opinions.csv (`agreement`).
  A slow/failed/absent LLM never changes or drops a decision; a spent AI budget
  says so on Telegram once a day.

STEP 7 — Sizing
  funding-rate-aware leverage + position size = RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT of ACCOUNT_BALANCE

STEP 8 — Confidence cap
  no sweep → confidence capped at NO_SWEEP_CONFIDENCE_CAP (69, just below STRONG)

STEP 9 — Alert + log (owner's tier system)
  BUY/SELL → Telegram (via the long-lived listener Bot); HOLD → silent
  quality < 50 → log-only (ignored); 50-60 NORMAL · 60-70 HIGH · 70+ STRONG
  every decision → signals_log.csv (28 columns, append-only); the CSV write is
  isolated per row — one disk error costs one row, never the rest of the scan
  HOLD rows are deduped by verdict+reason within HOLD_LOG_COOLDOWN_MIN (30) and
  logged at DEBUG; BUY/SELL stay at INFO
  a scan summary line reports universe / 1H directional / decided / funding /
  duplicates / gate_rejected / alerts / log_failed / telegram_failed / AI status

  Hard deadline: past SCAN_DEADLINE_SECONDS (240) the scan stops AI work,
  Python-fallbacks the rest, notifies Telegram — never bleeds into the next slot.
```

## Liquidity & sweeps

**Primary (layer 3, `liquidity.py`):** equal highs/lows are stop pools. A long
needs a **sell-side sweep + reclaim + a mandatory bullish confirmation candle**
(mirror for a short) — a bare touch is not an entry (`LIQ_CONFIRM_REQUIRED`).
This is real evidence the core acts on, not a score tweak.

**Secondary (`filter_1h.detect_sweep` → `scoring.py`):** the legacy wick-based
sweep detector is retained as an indicator-confirmation input.

```
BULLISH: lower wick pierces the 20-candle swing low, body closes back ABOVE it,
         wick > 2× body, volume spike vs the 20-candle avg
BEARISH: upper wick pierces the 20-candle swing high, body closes back BELOW it,
         wick > 2× body, volume spike vs the 20-candle avg
```

With no fresh sweep the alert's confidence is **capped at 69**
(`NO_SWEEP_CONFIDENCE_CAP`, just below the STRONG tier) and labelled in the
alert — see the sanctioned-deviations table in strategy_spec.md.

## Timeliness architecture

- **OHLCV TTL cache** (`scanner.py`), keyed `(symbol, timeframe)`, TTL = one candle
  period — cuts steady-state fetches from ~152/scan to ~11–50.
- **Concurrent fetch** — `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8)` with a shared
  token-bucket limiter so workers can't stampede the Binance rate limit.
- **Deadline** threaded through fetch + AI stages via `time.monotonic()`.

## AI capacity (audit + explanation)

The deterministic core decides every signal; the LLM writes prose and records an
independent opinion, so a slow, failed, or missing LLM is **cosmetic**. Today a
local template (`fallback.explanation_fallback`) writes the explanation and the
alert footer reads *"explanation generated locally"*. The batched transport is
retained for when the LLM prose is switched on: one request carries a whole
scan's candidates (sorted by setup_quality, chunked at `AI_BATCH_MAX = 20`), so
the free tier's 50/day cap rarely binds. `AI_MAX_TOKENS = 2000`, reasoning
disabled (documented starvation issue), retry/backoff on transient errors, then a
secondary model before the local template.

The audit path is `scan_coordinator.AIOpinionWorker`: bundles are built from the
same structured data the prompt needs (snapshots, sweep, liquidation, risk
levels), queued off the critical path (`AI_WORKER_MAX_PENDING`, drops rather than
blocks), and written to `ai_opinions.csv` — `UNAVAILABLE`/`FAILED` are labelled as
such, `agreement` grades the answer against what shipped, and a header that no
longer matches `AI_OPINION_COLUMNS` is archived (`ai_opinions.csv.vN.bak`) instead
of being written over. Nothing on this path feeds back into `decision.py`.
